# FIFAGoalCount  
With this app, individual performance can be tracked when playing FIFA together in "couch co-op" 
mode, either playing against other players or against the AI.

## History  
This little app was created to learn the basis of Android development with Kotlin. 
It all started with a primitive counter to analyze who performed better on a match day.
To track the performance over several match days, an option to save the data in a SQLite database was implemented. 
In addition, the libraries [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) and 
[Konfetti](https://github.com/DanielMartinus/Konfetti) were added.
MPAndroidChart is used to display statistics in a clean and intuitive way.
Konfetti adds a nice and satisfying animation every time a goal is scored.

## The App  
The app itself has four different screens:
